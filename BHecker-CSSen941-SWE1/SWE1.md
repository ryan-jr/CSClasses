### Lecture 1: The Software Proccess

* Fundamental assumption that good processes lead to good software and reduce risk

* Risk managment asks what can go wrong in a software project and how can risk be reduced?

* The general process is Feasability/Planning -> Requirements -> Design -> Implementation -> Operation/Maintance.  Requirments, design, and implementation is generally considered the software engineering process.  

* Waterfall model: Requirements def-> system/software design-> program/unit testing-> integration and system testing-> operation/maintenance.  Advantages of the waterfall model: Process visibility, dpeendence on individuals, quality control, cost control.  Disadvatnages: Each stage in the process reveals new understanding of the previous stages which requires the earlier stages to be revised.  

* Iterative development is intial implemetnation for user comment, followed by refinement until system is complete.  Vaporware: user interface mock-up, Throw away software components, dummy modules, rapid prototyping, successive refinement.  

* Completed projects should look like the waterfall model, but the development process is always partly evolutionary and risk is decreased through prototyping components, dividing development into phases, following a transparent software process, making use of reusable components.  

* Fesability study usually looks at the client, the scope, benefits, resources needed, potential obstacles/risks and how they can be minimized

* THe feasability leads to a decision

### Lecture 2: Developing Requirements

* Domain Analysis is the process by which a SWE learns about the domain to better understand the problem.  THe domain is the generalf field of business/tech in which the clients w. use the software.  A domain expert is a person who has a deep knowledge fo the domain.  

* Defining the problem/scope.  A problem can be expressed a a difficulty users/customers are facing or as an opportunity that will resutl in some benefit such as improved productivity/sales.  

* Defining the scope.  Narrow the scope by defining a more precise problem (List all the things you might imagine the system doing, exclude things if they are too broad, and determine high level goals if things are too narrow)

* A requirement is a statmeent about the propsed system that all stakeholders agree must be made true in order for the customers problem to be solved adequatley.  (Short and concise, says somethign about the system, All stakeholders have agreed it is valid, helps solve the problem).  A collection of requirments is a requirements document.  FUnctional requirements describe what the system should do.  Non-functional requriements are constraints that must be adhered to during development.
