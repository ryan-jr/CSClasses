# Lesson 1

* Deep learning is variation of machine learning

* Alfred Samuels created machine/deep learning by programing a machine to play checkers better than hem

* A lot of times people create super specialized AI models (e.g. to find cancer etc...), we're trying to create a super flexible model/function that is fast/scalable with takes a variety of paramaters.  

* Deep learning uses a neural network that that uses linear layers interspersed with nonlinear layers, which is massively flexible.  

* The paramaters are based on a gradient descent to find the variety of paramaters that work, but it may not normally done in a reasonable amount of time, but GPUs have solved this recently in the last few years.

* Deep learning is a neural network with tons of hidden layers.  

* What is convolution in convolution neural network?  A convolution is a linear operation. 

* A lienar layer combined into a nonlinear layer, is a key part of a neural network.  

* The learning rate, is the small step we take to make the result better and better.
